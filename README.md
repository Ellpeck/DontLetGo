# DontLetGo (now Don't Wake Up)
Don't Wake Up (which was called Don't Let Go in dev, and I, frankly, were too lazy to rename the project and the repository) is a short puzzle game about depression and panic attacks that I made in a week or so while feeling *particularly* depressed.

The code is rough, messy and terrible, but this is a small game, so it honestly doesn't need to be good. It just needs to work. And that's what it does. I hope.

Have fun looking at it anyway, though. Maybe you'll learn something. Maybe you'll steal it, too. Please don't do that, though.
